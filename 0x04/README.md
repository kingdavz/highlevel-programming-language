# Tuple and Lists
A Tuple is a built in python data type used to store multiple items in a single variable. It is ordered,immutable and is defined using the parentheses '()'.

A list is also a built-in python datatype that is used to store multiple values in a single variable, they are ordered and changeable.Each iteem in a list has a positon, called index, starting from 0, it is defined using square brackets '[]'

# Differences
1. Mutability: lists are mutable meaning the values can be changed or removed,while a tuple is immutable once created you cannot change items.
2. Syntax: lists make use of square brackets '[]', while tuples makes use of parentheses '()'
3. Memory: a list uses more memory due to flexibilty, while tuple uses less memory
